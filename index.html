Cloud Washing
</trcglossword>
<br>
For the last several years "the cloud" has been a hot term to such an extent that an episode of Family Guy referenced it.

As a result, management of publicly held companies may feel compelled to classify revenue as being "cloud revenue" with the intent of increasing the firm's stock price and thus their compensation.
</div>

<trcglossword>

</trcglossword>
<br>

Cookie Jar Accounting
</trcglossword>
<br>
While it may be easy to understand that a firm's management may decide to overstate earnings to maximize its compensation, it may be less obvious that management may also understate income in order to maximize its compensation.
<br>
All other factors held constant, the market capitalization of a firm whose earnings are linear may be greater than a firm whose earning's vary widely quarter to quarter, even if the total earnings over a year are the same for both firms.
<br>
Recognizing this, the management of a firm may use or exceed its discretion under GAAP to use reserves in order to smooth income.

However, even within the field of finance, the abbreviation PE could mean private equity, or it could mean price earnings ratio.
</div>

<trcglossword>
Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA or "The Dow" )

</trcglossword>

Standards put forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board for financial statements.
<br>
In theory, the role of the executive leadership of a publicly held company is to manage the firm on behalf of its shareholders.
<br>
In reality, the role of executive leadership is to exercise the discretion allowed in generally accepted accounting principles to maximize its own compensation.
<br>
If the discretion allowed in generally accepted accounting principles proves to be inadequate to paint the picture that management wishes to paint, then management may resort to alternative measures such as "earnings before interest taxes and depreciation".

Toys R Us is one leveraged buy out that Bain Capital was involved with that people may be familiar with.
<br>
Debt was issued to buy the public shares.
<br>
Toys R Us was unable to pay its debt from the buyout as it came due, leading to the liquidation of the company.

Back when the iHeartMedia was called Clear Channel Communications, debt was used to purchase the publicly traded shares.
<br>
The company was unable to meet its debt obligations.

The company has changed its name from Clear Channel Communications to iHeartMedia.

<br>
A closed-end fund is bought and sold on an exchange just like any of the companies that trade on a stock exchange.
<br>
An exchange traded fund has attributes of both an open-end furn and a closed-end fund.
<br>
An exchange traded fund is bought and sold on an exchange like a closed end fund, but there is a mechanism for shares to be created and dissovled.
<br>
Because shares can be created and dissolved, the trading price and the net asset value will usually be close or extremely close.

Retention Bonus
</trcglossword>
<br>
As an ordinary employee you are best served by working at company that is ideally growing at a steady pace.
<br>
A senior executive will also likely be compensated best at a firm that is growing.
<br>
However, unlike an ordinary employee, for a senior executive the next best thing to a growing firm may be a firm approaching bankruptcy.
<br>
The period leading up to bankruptcy can prove to be ideal for a firm's executive leadership.
<br>
The value of the firms equity will be shrinking but the debt holders will have yet to take control.
<br>
As such, management may decide it is free to grant itself retention bonuses without fear of oversight.

<div class="glossbackground"></label>
<trcglossword>
Talking One's Book
</trcglossword>
<br>
In this context, think of "book" as a synonym for "portfolio".
<br>
A given manager of a portfolio may or may not believe that the securities that he or she manages represent a good value.
<br>
If a manager intends to keep the securities that are in the portfolio, publicly "talking his or her book" may creating buying interest leading to a higher value of the portfolio.
<br>
Alternatively, if a portfolio manager intends to liquidate securities in a portfolio that he or she manages, the manager may "talk his book" in order to interest buyers in the securities in order make it easier to liquidate.
