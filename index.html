Cloud Washing
</trcglossword>
<br>
For the last several years "the cloud" has been a hot term to such an extent that an episode of Family Guy referenced it.

As a result, management of publicly held companies may feel compelled to classify revenue as being "cloud revenue" with the intent of increasing the firm's stock price and thus their compensation.

Cookie Jar Accounting
</trcglossword>
<br>
While it may be easy to understand that a firm's management may decide to overstate earnings to maximize its compensation, it may be less obvious that management may also understate income in order to maximize its compensation.
<br>
All other factors held constant, the market capitalization of a firm whose earnings are linear may be greater than a firm whose earning's vary widely quarter to quarter, even if the total earnings over a year are the same for both firms.
<br>
Recognizing this, the management of a firm may use or exceed its discretion under GAAP to use reserves in order to smooth income.

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP )
</trcglossword>
<br>
Standards put forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board for financial statements.
<br>
In theory, the role of the executive leadership of a publicly held company is to manage the firm on behalf of its shareholders.
<br>
In reality, the role of executive leadership is to exercise the discretion allowed in generally accepted accounting principles to maximize its own compensation.
<br>
If the discretion allowed in generally accepted accounting principles proves to be inadequate to paint the picture that management wishes to paint, then management may resort to alternative measures such as "earnings before interest taxes and depreciation".
