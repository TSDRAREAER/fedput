<p class="bodyline" style="margin-left:2px;margin-right:30px;margin-top:5px";>
This website is a spin-off of <a href="https://therationalconsumer.com">therationalconsumer.com</a>.
<br>
I make absolutely no claim to having any original ideas.
<br>
I would like to think I may have summarized some concepts better than others have, but even that claim may prove to be but baseless vanity.
<br>
Whether the popularity of this site proves to be more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laverne_%26_Shirley">Laverne and Shirley</a> or more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanie_Loves_Chachi">Joanie Loves Chachi</a> is ultimately in your collective hands.
<br>
Given the fear that this information might be misused, I was initially reluctant to launch this site.
<br>
However, seeing people not merely follow but purchase meme stocks such as Gamestop helped convince me that people may engage in reckless behavior regardless of whether I post this website or not.
<br>
If you believe that you or anyone has some strategy that will allow you to consistently outperform the overall market, I implore you to proceed with extreme caution.

Cookie Jar Accounting
</trcglossword>
<br>
While it may be easy to understand that a firm's management may decide to overstate earnings to maximize its compensation, it may be less obvious that management may also understate income in order to maximize its compensation.
<br>
All other factors held constant, the market capitalization of a firm whose earnings are linear may be greater than a firm whose earning's vary widely quarter to quarter, even if the total earnings over a year are the same for both firms.

Recognizing this, the management of a firm may use or exceed its discretion under GAAP to use reserves in order to smooth income.
